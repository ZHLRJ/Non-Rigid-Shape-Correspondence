# Non-Rigid-Shape-Correspondence

**Unsupervised Landmark Discovery via Karcher Means for Non-Rigid Shape Correspondence**

This repository contains the official implementation of our method for discovering intrinsic landmarks in 3D shapes for dense correspondence tasks. Our approach computes unsupervised, repeatable, and geometrically meaningful landmarks based on the intrinsic geometry of the surface, enabling robust shape matching without the need for manually labeled annotations.

## 🔍 Overview

Establishing dense shape correspondence across non-rigid 3D surfaces is a long-standing challenge. This project introduces an unsupervised method that:
- Computes intrinsic landmarks using **geometric medians** (Karcher means),
- Selects salient points via **farthest point sampling** over the intrinsic domain,
- Supports matching under **near-isometric deformations**,
- Can be integrated into existing **functional map pipelines**.
